# AnomalyDetectionVIAPyCaret
This project explores anomaly detection using PyCaret, focusing on Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Isolation Forest (IForest). It identifies outliers in a dataset by leveraging unsupervised learning techniques. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, anomaly scoring, and visualization of detected anomalies.
